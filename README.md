## About me

ðŸ”­ Right now, I'm diving into computer vision, large language models (LLMs), and using mathematics to visualize complex ideas in AI. (BIG FAN OF 3B1B)  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m on a journey to understand how AI can bridge the gap between perception and understanding, especially in the realm of autonomous systems and interactive models.  
ðŸ‘¯ Always open to collaborating on projects that blend AI, computer vision, and the art of visualizing abstract concepts through math.  
ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about the intersection of AI and human thought, chess strategies, or how to make sense of a world powered by algorithms.  
ðŸ“« Want to connect? Drop me a line via GitHub or email (saadqasim2015@gmail.com).  
âš¡ Fun fact: Magnus Carlsen is to chess what Michael Jordan is to basketball!

## ðŸ“‚ Projects & Contributions

- ðŸŽ® [Mimir: Tablut AI Agent](https://github.com/francescoriccardocrescenzi/mimir)  
  Collaborated on building an AI agent for the Tablut board game using **Minimax** and **heuristic-based search** techniques. The project focused on strategic decision-making under time constraints, simulating intelligent gameplay.
